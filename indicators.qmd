# Statistical Indicators

## Correlation Analysis

**Purpose**:
Measure the strength of linear relationship between two asset price series.

**How**:

- Computed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
- **Inputs**: Price series of both assets.
- **Outputs**: A value between -1 and 1.

**Interpretation**:

- Values close to 1 indicate strong positive correlation.
- Values close to -1 indicate strong negative correlation.
- Values close to 0 indicate little or no correlation.
- For pair trading, correlations above 0.7 are generally desirable.

## Cointegration Test

**Purpose**:
Test for a long-term equilibrium relationship between two asset price series.

**How**:

- Computed using `coint()` from `statsmodels.tsa.stattools`.
- **Inputs**: Price series of both assets.
- **Outputs**: Test statistic and p-value.

**Interpretation**:

- **p-value < 0.05**: Reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration.
- A p-value below 0.05 suggests the pair is suitable for trading, indicating that prices may diverge temporarily but tend to revert to equilibrium.

## Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test

**Purpose**:
Test whether the spread between two assets is stationary.

**How**:

- Computed using `adfuller()` from `statsmodels.tsa.stattools`.
- **Input**: Log spread between two assets (i.e. log price A - log price B).
- **Outputs**: Test statistic and p-value.

**Interpretation**:

- **p-value < 0.05**: Reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity.
- Indicates that the spread is stationary and likely to mean-revert.
- Suitable for pair trading when p < 0.05.

## Half-Life Calculation

**Purpose**:
Measure how quickly the spread reverts to its mean.

**How**:

- Based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reversion process.
- Derived from a regression of the spread change against its lagged value.

**Formula**:

- Run an AR(1) regression on the spread series:
  $$
  \Delta \text{Spread}_t = \alpha + \rho \cdot \text{Spread}_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
  $$
- Then calculate the half-life using:
  $$
  \text{Half-life} = \frac{-\ln(2)}{\rho}
  $$

**Interpretation**:

- **5-25 days**: Ideal half-life range for pair trading.
- **< 5 days**: Very rapid mean reversion, may lead to frequent trading.
- **25-60 days**: Slower mean reversion, requiring longer holding periods.
- **> 60 days or negative**: May not be suitable for pair trading.

# Trading Signals

## Z-Score

**Purpose**:
Measure how many standard deviations the current spread deviates from its mean.

**How**:

- Based on the rolling mean and standard deviation of the spread.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Z-score} = \frac{\text{Current Spread} - \text{Rolling Mean}}{\text{Rolling Standard Deviation}}
  $$
- Typically uses a 20-day rolling window.

**Interpretation**:

- **|Z-score| > 2**: Typical entry signal threshold.
- **|Z-score| < 0.5**: Typical exit signal threshold.
- High absolute Z-score values indicate extreme divergence from the normal relationship.

## VIX-Adjusted Thresholds

**Purpose**:
Adapt entry thresholds based on market volatility.

**How**:

- Uses VIX index levels to adjust the Z-score thresholds.
- Higher VIX values lead to higher threshold requirements.

**Interpretation**:

- **VIX < 20**: Entry threshold = 2.0
- **VIX 20-25**: Entry threshold = 2.25
- **VIX 25-30**: Entry threshold = 2.5
- **VIX > 30**: Entry threshold = 3.0
- A higher threshold during periods of high volatility reduces false signals.

# Trade Execution

## Entry Signals

**Purpose**:
Determine when to enter pair trades.

**How**:

- Based on the Z-score crossing the adjusted threshold values.
- **Signal Examples**:
  - Z-score > threshold: Short asset A, Long asset B.
  - Z-score < -threshold: Long asset A, Short asset B.

**Interpretation**:

- A positive Z-score indicates that the spread is wider than normal.
- A negative Z-score indicates that the spread is narrower than normal.
- A large absolute Z-score suggests a higher probability of mean reversion.

## Exit Signals

**Purpose**:
Determine when to exit pair trades.

**How**:

- **Primary exit**: When the Z-score returns to the ±0.5 range.
- **Secondary exits**: Based on time-based or risk-based conditions.

**Additional Exit Conditions**:

- **Maximum holding time**: 1.5 × half-life days.
- **Stop-loss**: 5% divergence between the pair.

# Performance Metrics

## Trade Success Rate

**Purpose**:
Measure the percentage of profitable trades.

**How**:

- Calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Trade Success Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Profitable Trades}}{\text{Total Number of Trades}}\right) \times 100\%
  $$

**Interpretation**:

- Higher percentages indicate a more reliable strategy.
- Should be evaluated alongside the average profit or loss per trade.

## Total Return

**Purpose**:
Measure the overall profitability of the strategy.

**How**:

- Calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Total Return} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Portfolio Value} - \text{Initial Portfolio Value}}{\text{Initial Portfolio Value}}\right) \times 100\%
  $$

**Interpretation**:

- Positive values indicate a profitable strategy.
- Should be compared to benchmark returns over the same period.
