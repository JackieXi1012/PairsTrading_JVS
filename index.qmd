## Pairs Trading Strategy Overview
Pairs Trading is a **market-neutral strategy** designed to profit from **temporary price divergences** between two historically correlated assets. Rather than betting on market direction, it aims to capture **statistical arbitrage opportunities** when the price relationship between two assets temporarily drifts from its historical mean.

<br>
This strategy offers a robust approach in volatile markets, by:

- Targeting **mean reversion** in asset pairs
- Utilizing **long-short positions** to hedge market-wide movements
- Focusing on **relative pricing** rather than absolute market trends

<br>

By identifying pairs that move together historically, the strategy capitalizes when their prices diverge and then revert — creating opportunities for **low-risk, data-driven trading**.
