# Strategy Introduction

Our strategy is based on **Pairs Trading**, a market-neutral approach designed to profit from pricing inefficiencies between two historically correlated assets. By balancing long and short positions simultaneously, we reduce overall market risk and rely on **mean reversion** to capture gains.

We identify trading pairs using:

- **Pearson correlation** ≥ 0.7
- **ADF cointegration test** with p-value < 0.05
- **Half-life** of mean reversion between 5–25 days

Once a pair is selected, we monitor its **spread** and calculate the **Z-score**:

  $$Z\text{-score} = \frac{\text{Spread} - \text{20-day Mean}}{\text{20-day Standard Deviation}}$$
