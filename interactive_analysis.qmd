## Introduction {.content-block}

This interactive analysis tool lets you perform pairs trading analysis on any two stocks of your choice. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that matches a long position in one stock with a short position in another stock that has historically moved in a similar pattern. When the pair diverges from its historical relationship, a trade is initiated with the expectation that the relationship will revert to its mean.

Use the tool below to analyze potential pairs trading opportunities. Simply enter the ticker symbols for two stocks and adjust the trading parameters as needed.

## Interpretation Guide {.content-block}

### Statistical Indicators

- **Correlation**: Values above 0.7 indicate strong correlation, suitable for pairs trading
- **Cointegration p-value**: Values below 0.05 suggest the pair is cointegrated
- **ADF p-value**: Values below 0.05 indicate the spread is stationary
- **Half-life**: Optimal values range from 5 to 60 days

### Trading Signals

The Z-score chart shows the normalized deviation of the pair relationship:

- **Entry Signals**: Positions are opened when the Z-score crosses beyond the threshold lines (typically ±2.0)
- **Exit Signals**: Positions are closed when the Z-score returns to the mean (between ±0.5)

## About The Implementation {.content-block}

This interactive tool is powered by Streamlit and uses the `interactive_pairs.py` module to perform the analysis. The analysis includes:

- Historical price data retrieval
- Statistical tests for correlation and cointegration
- Z-score calculation for trading signals
- Backtesting with position tracking
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown

For more technical details on the implementation, please see the [sample_pairs.qmd](sample_pairs.qmd) document or examine the source code on GitHub.
