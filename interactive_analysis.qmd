## Introduction {.content-block}

This interactive analysis tool lets you perform pairs trading analysis on any two stocks of your choice. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that matches a long position in one stock with a short position in another stock that has historically moved in a similar pattern. When the pair diverges from its historical relationship, a trade is initiated with the expectation that the relationship will revert to its mean.

## How To Use {.content-block}

1. **Select Stock Pairs**: Enter the ticker symbols for two stocks in the sidebar (e.g., "AZO" and "ORLY")
2. **Configure Parameters**:
   - **Initial Capital**: Set the starting investment amount
   - **Shares Per Trade**: Specify how many shares to trade with each signal
   - **Stop-Loss Percentage**: Set the maximum loss allowed before exiting a position
3. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Pair" button to generate results
4. **Review Results**: Examine the statistical analysis, performance metrics, and visualizations

## Interpretation Guide {.content-block}

### Statistical Indicators

- **Correlation**: Values above 0.7 indicate strong correlation, suitable for pairs trading
- **Cointegration p-value**: Values below 0.05 suggest the pair is cointegrated
- **ADF p-value**: Values below 0.05 indicate the spread is stationary
- **Half-life**: Optimal values range from 5 to 60 days

### Trading Signals

The Z-score chart shows the normalized deviation of the pair relationship:

- **Entry Signals**: Positions are opened when the Z-score crosses beyond the threshold lines (typically ±2.0)
- **Exit Signals**: Positions are closed when the Z-score returns to the mean (between ±0.5)

## About The Implementation {.content-block}

This interactive tool is powered by Streamlit and uses the `interactive_pairs.py` module to perform the analysis. The analysis includes:

- Historical price data retrieval
- Statistical tests for correlation and cointegration
- Z-score calculation for trading signals
- Backtesting with position tracking
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown

For more technical details on the implementation, please see the [sample_pairs.qmd](sample_pairs.qmd) document or examine the source code on GitHub.
