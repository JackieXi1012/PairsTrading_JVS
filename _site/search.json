    "section": "",
    "text": "Our strategy is a market-neutral pairs trading approach designed to profit from relative mispricings between highly correlated stocks. By identifying asset pairs (e.g., AMD and NVIDIA) that exhibit historical cointegration, we aim to exploit the natural tendency of their price spread to revert to the mean. Using a one-year lookback window, we screen for pairs with high Pearson correlation (≥ 0.7) and statistically significant cointegration (ADF test p-value &lt; 0.05).\nTrades are triggered when the Z-score of the spread exceeds ±2.0 under low volatility (VIX &lt; 20), adjusted upwards in more volatile markets. We enter long-short positions accordingly—buying the undervalued stock and shorting the overvalued one—and exit upon Z-score reversion to ±0.5 or when time or stop-loss conditions are met.\nRisk is managed through dollar-neutral positioning, a strict 5% stop-loss, and diversification across 3–5 trading pairs. This systematic, data-driven approach allows us to generate alpha while minimizing exposure to market direction."
