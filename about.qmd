## Background & Motivation

In volatile and uncertain markets, market-neutral strategies provide a way to generate returns independent of broader market movements. Our strategy is inspired by the classic concept of **pairs trading**, which identifies two historically correlated stocks and exploits temporary deviations in their price spread. This method allows us to capitalize on mean-reverting behavior while maintaining a neutral exposure to the overall market.

## Strategy Design

We begin by screening for candidate pairs using:

- **Pearson Correlation ≥ 0.7** over a 1-year window
- **Cointegration** verified by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (p-value < 0.05)

From this universe, we select pairs like **AMD vs. NVIDIA** that meet the statistical requirements and have strong economic or industry logic.

We compute the **Z-score** of the price spread and define our signals as:

- **Enter Long-Short**: when Z-score > 2.0 or < –2.0
- **Exit**: when Z-score reverts to between –0.5 and +0.5

Volatility filtering is also applied: we only trade when the **VIX < 20**, dynamically increasing thresholds in more volatile periods.

## Mathematical Formulas

### 1. Asset Pair Selection
- Using Pearson correlation coefficient to filter pairs with correlation > 0.7
- Applying ADF cointegration test to confirm spread stationarity (p-value < 0.05)
- Calculating half-life and prioritizing pairs with half-life between 5-25 days

### 2. Signal Generation
- Daily log prices calculation:
  $$\text{Log Price}_A = \log(\text{Price}_A)$$

- Spread calculation:
  $$\text{Spread} = \text{Log Price}_A - \text{Log Price}_B$$

- Z-score calculation:
  $$Z\text{-score} = \frac{\text{Spread} - \text{20-day Mean}}{\text{20-day Standard Deviation}}$$

### 3. Trading Rules
- Entry signals:
  - Long-short pair when $Z\text{-score} > 2.0$
  - Short-long pair when $Z\text{-score} < -2.0$

- Exit signals:
  - Close position when $|Z\text{-score}| < 0.5$
  - Or after $1.5 \times \text{half-life}$ days
  - Or hit 5% stop-loss

## Risk Management

To ensure capital protection and stable performance, we include:

- **Dollar-neutral positions** for each pair
- **Stop-loss of 5%** per position
- **Diversification** across 3–5 pairs
- **Maximum holding period** of 30 trading days

This structure helps us reduce systemic risk while relying on price relationships between stocks, not market direction.

## Why It Works

Statistical arbitrage strategies like ours benefit from the natural tendency of related stocks to **mean-revert** after short-term shocks. By combining statistical rigor with practical filters like the VIX, we improve trade reliability and reduce noise. This strategy provides a **quantitative, risk-controlled framework** to exploit inefficiencies in the market.
