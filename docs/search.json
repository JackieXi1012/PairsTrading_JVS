    "text": "1 Pairs Trading Strategy Overview\nPairs Trading is a market-neutral strategy designed to profit from temporary price divergences between two historically correlated assets. Rather than betting on market direction, it aims to capture statistical arbitrage opportunities when the price relationship between two assets temporarily drifts from its historical mean.\n This strategy offers a robust approach in volatile markets, by:\n\nTargeting mean reversion in asset pairs\nUtilizing long-short positions to hedge market-wide movements\nFocusing on relative pricing rather than absolute market trends\n\n\nBy identifying pairs that move together historically, the strategy capitalizes when their prices diverge and then revert — creating opportunities for low-risk, data-driven trading."

Key steps include:\n\nCorrelation Screening: We select pairs with strong historical price correlation (typically over 0.7) based on daily data over one year.\nCointegration Validation: Statistical tests confirm that the selected price series maintain a long-term equilibrium relationship.\nDynamic Signal Generation: Our entry and exit signals are derived from the Z-score of the price spread, which adapts to market conditions with volatility adjustments via the VIX index."
