    "text": "Why It Works\nStatistical arbitrage strategies like ours benefit from the natural tendency of related stocks to mean-revert after short-term shocks. By combining statistical rigor with practical filters like the VIX, we improve trade reliability and reduce noise. This strategy provides a quantitative, risk-controlled framework to exploit inefficiencies in the market."
