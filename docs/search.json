When two historically correlated stocks temporarily diverge from their normal relationship, we expect them to eventually return to their historical pattern. The strategy is implemented as follows:\n\nIdentify pairs of stocks that historically move together\nMonitor the spread between the prices of the two stocks\nCalculate the Z-score to identify when the spread deviates significantly from its historical mean\nEnter a trade when the Z-score exceeds a threshold (indicating the spread is abnormally wide)\nExit the trade when the spread returns to normal levels\n\nIn our AZO-ORLY pairs trading strategy, we’ll: - Go long AZO and short ORLY when the Z-score is significantly negative (AZO is undervalued relative to ORLY) - Go short AZO and long ORLY when the Z-score is significantly positive (AZO is overvalued relative to ORLY)"

This helps us track how our positions perform while we’re holding them. Here’s what each column tells us:\n\nDate: The trading day\nPosition: Number of shares we’re holding (positive for long AZO/short ORLY, negative for short AZO/long ORLY)\nCash: Available funds in our account\nStock Prices: Daily closing prices for AZO and ORLY\nPortfolio Value: Total value of our account (cash + market value of positions)\n\nWhen examining an active position in the ledger:\n\nTracking the spread: By looking at how AZO and ORLY prices change day-to-day, we can see if the spread is narrowing (moving toward our profit target) or widening (moving against us).\nMark-to-market performance: The portfolio value column shows how our total account value fluctuates while the position is open, providing a daily assessment of unrealized gains or losses.\nRisk assessment: Monitoring our portfolio value helps us decide whether to exit a position early if it moves significantly against us.\n\nThe final row shows the status at the end of our trading period, giving us a complete picture of where our account stands after all trades have been executed.\n\n\nPerformance Metrics\n\n\nInitial Capital: $1,000,000.00\nFinal Assets: $1,015,121.00\nTotal Return: 1.51%\nAnnualized Return: 36.47%\nAnnualized Volatility: 84.47%\nSharpe Ratio: 0.4318\nMaximum Drawdown: -34.16%\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Performance Metrics\nThe performance metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of our pairs trading strategy. Let’s understand what each metric means:\n\nTotal Return: The overall percentage gain or loss on our initial investment over the entire backtest period. This is our bottom-line performance indicator.\nAnnualized Return: The return expressed as a yearly percentage, which allows us to compare this strategy with other investment opportunities.\nAnnualized Volatility: The standard deviation of daily returns, annualized to show how much our portfolio value fluctuates over a year. Lower volatility generally indicates a more stable strategy.\nSharpe Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted return. It tells us how much excess return we’re earning for each unit of risk:\n\nSharpe ratio &gt; 1.0: Good risk-adjusted return\nSharpe ratio &gt; 2.0: Excellent risk-adjusted return\nSharpe ratio &lt; 0: Strategy underperforms the risk-free rate\n\nMaximum Drawdown: The largest percentage drop in portfolio value from a peak to a subsequent trough. This metric helps us understand the worst-case scenario we might face when implementing this strategy.\n\nThese metrics help us assess whether our pairs trading strategy is: - Profitable (total return, annualized return) - Consistent (volatility, Sharpe ratio) - Manageable in terms of risk (maximum drawdown)\nFor the AZO-ORLY pair, we can compare these metrics against market benchmarks and alternative strategies to determine whether this pairs trading approach is worth pursuing."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nOur analysis of the AZO-ORLY pairs trading strategy demonstrates the potential of statistical arbitrage in the automotive retail sector. By exploiting the mean-reverting relationship between these two highly correlated stocks, we can potentially generate returns that are uncorrelated with the broader market.\nThe backtest results show that this strategy can be profitable when implemented with proper risk management and precise execution. The performance metrics—particularly the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown—suggest that this approach could be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio.\nBefore deploying real capital, consider running this strategy on paper trading for several weeks to validate its performance in current market conditions. Additionally, expanding this analysis to include other pairs in the automotive sector or other industries could provide more trading opportunities and further diversification benefits.\nBy following the implementation guidelines and being mindful of the limitations, this pairs trading strategy could become a consistent source of alpha in your investment portfolio."
