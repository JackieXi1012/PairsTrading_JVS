Pairs Trading is a market-neutral strategy designed to profit from temporary price divergences between two historically correlated assets. Rather than betting on market direction, it aims to capture statistical arbitrage opportunities when the price relationship between two assets temporarily drifts from its historical mean.\n\nThis strategy offers a robust approach in volatile markets, by:\n\nTargeting mean reversion in asset pairs\nUtilizing long-short positions to hedge market-wide movements\nFocusing on relative pricing rather than absolute market trends\n\n\nBy identifying pairs that move together historically, the strategy capitalizes when their prices diverge and then revert — creating opportunities for low-risk, data-driven trading."

    "text": "In volatile and uncertain markets, market-neutral strategies provide a way to generate returns independent of broader market movements. Our strategy is inspired by the classic concept of pairs trading, which identifies two historically correlated stocks and exploits temporary deviations in their price spread. This method allows us to capitalize on mean-reverting behavior while maintaining a neutral exposure to the overall market."
